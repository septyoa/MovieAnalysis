# MovieAnalysis
In this project, I act as a Data Analyst for Online Movie Rent Platform and help the company to choose which movies they should add to their service, based on Gross, IMDB Score, Genre, Company, Country of Origin, and Year of Release. I analyzed the correlation between Gross and IMDB Scores, which country has the average of highest rated movies, which company generated more money, etc. I also curated 99 titles of movies to be served on the platform, and using Confidence Interval, I predicted the revenue to be between IDR 77.846.400 and IDR 105.549.750
